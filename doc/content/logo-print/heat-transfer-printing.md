## 1. Understanding the Basics

### What Is Heat Transfer Printing?

- **Definition**: A process where a design is printed on special heat-sensitive paper or film, then transferred to a surface using a heat press.
- **Common Names**: Heat press printing, thermal transfer—because it’s too cool for just one name.
- **Core Principle**: Heat (300°F-400°F) and pressure bond the ink to the material, locking in a crisp, lasting print.

### How It’s Classified

- **By Process**: Indirect—design hits the transfer medium first, then the product.
- **By Materials**: Transfer papers or films, heat-sensitive inks (sublimation, pigment, vinyl), and substrates like fabrics, plastics, or metals.
- **By Applications**: Apparel (T-shirts, hats), promo items (mugs, bags), industrial labeling, and even home décor.

**Fun Fact**: Heat transfer printing’s roots go back to the 18th century—originally for industrial use, now it’s decorating cakes. Who knew your logo could be edible?
