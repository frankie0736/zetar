## 1. Understanding the Basics

### What Is Hot-Stamping?

- **Definition**: A printing process where a heated die presses foil onto a surface, transferring a design with precision and permanence.
- **Common Names**: Foil-stamping, dry foil printing, hot foil printing—because who doesn’t love a good alias?
- **Core Principle**: Heat activates the foil’s adhesive layer, bonding it to the material, while a release layer lets the foil peel away, leaving your logo behind.

### Classification of Hot-Stamping

- **By Process**: A relief printing method where the design pops up from the surface.
- **By Materials**: Uses metallized or painted roll-leaf carriers in a rainbow of colors and finishes.
- **By Applications**: Seen everywhere from packaging to luxury goods and even industrial labeling.

**Fun Fact**: Hot-stamping started in the 19th century to jazz up book covers. Now, it’s putting logos on everything—proof that old tricks can still impress!
