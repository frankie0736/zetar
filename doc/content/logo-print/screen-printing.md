- **Definition**: A printing process where ink is forced through a mesh screen onto a surface, using a stencil to create your logo or design.
- **Common Names**: Silk screening, serigraphy—because who doesn’t love a fancy alias?
- **Core Principle**: A stencil on the mesh allows ink to pass through only in specific areas, while a squeegee ensures even application.

### Classification of Screen Printing
